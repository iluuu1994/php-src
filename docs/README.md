# php-src docs

This is the home of the php-src internal documentation. It is in very early stages, but is intended to become the
primary place where new information about php-src is documented. Over time, it is expected to replace various mediums
like:

* https://www.phpinternalsbook.com/
* https://wiki.php.net/internals
* Blogs from contributors

## Credits

### PHP Internals Book

While the bulk of the work hasn't happened yet, a substantial amount of content is expected to be ported from the PHP
Internals Book.
